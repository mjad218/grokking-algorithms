# Grokking Algorithms

Challenge to read Grokking Algorithms in 20 Days ~ 11 Chapters

I will try reading a topic everyday and solve some problems that are relevant to this topic from leetcode.

I will go with Python as the book uses python for the examples and I am a language independent programmer.

Today is July 12 2022, Chapter one - Binary Search

## Chapter One

It's an introduction to algorithms, binary search, and the big O() notation.
